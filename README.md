# English Speaking Practice

A personal language-learning tool for practising free speaking in English (B2 level), built with the Birkenbihl method (decoding + passive listening) combined with shadowing exercises and Amazon Polly audio with karaoke-style word highlighting.

**Live:** [nicdev02.github.io/English-Practice](https://nicdev02.github.io/English-Practice/)

## Features

- **Read tab** — dialog in two views: original English and clean German translation
- **Listen & follow tab** — karaoke-style word highlighting synced to Amazon Polly audio; click any word to jump to that position and start playback; per-speaker line layout; speaker filter (show only A, B, or both); adjustable playback speed
- **Vocabulary tab** — lesson word list (EN / DE)

## Audio workflow

Lessons ship with **pre-configured audio** — no setup needed on any device including mobile. Audio files live in the repo and are embedded at build time:

- MP3 → `public/audio/`
- Speech Marks (`.marks`) → `public/speech-marks/`

Speaker attribution (who said what) comes from the lesson JSON, not the audio. The audio is a flat recording; Amazon Polly's word-level Speech Marks provide only the timestamps for karaoke highlighting.

Send Polly **plain dialog text without speaker labels** — one line per utterance is fine. This gives a 1:1 match between speech marks and displayed words for accurate sync.

Note: em dashes (`—`) are skipped during sync matching because Polly doesn't produce a speech mark for them. Underscore-joined identifiers (e.g. `flag_outliers`) are split by Polly into separate marks (`flag_`, `outliers`) and automatically re-joined during matching. The sync stays accurate in both cases.

## Tech stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Plain CSS with custom properties (no UI library)
- Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (auto-deploy on push to `main`)

## Adding a new lesson

1. Create a new file in [src/data/lessons/](src/data/lessons/) following the naming convention `NN-slug.json`.
2. Use this JSON schema:

The `tag` must match one of the dashboard categories: `"Uni / Data Science"`, `"Konferenz"`, or `"Alltag"`.

```json
{
  "id": "06-my-lesson",
  "title": "My lesson title",
  "eyebrow": "Einheit 1 · Context",
  "tag": "Uni / Data Science",
  "locked": false,
  "lines": [
    { "speaker": "A", "speakerName": "Anna", "text": "Hello." },
    { "speaker": "B", "speakerName": "Ben",  "text": "Hi there." }
  ],
  "decoded": [
    { "speaker": "A", "original": "Hello.", "wordForWord": "Hallo." },
    { "speaker": "B", "original": "Hi there.", "wordForWord": "Hei da drüben." }
  ],
  "cleanTranslation": [
    { "speaker": "A", "text": "Hallo." },
    { "speaker": "B", "text": "Hi." }
  ],
  "vocab": [
    { "en": "example phrase", "de": "Beispielphrase", "note": "optional note" }
  ]
}
```

3. Import the file in [src/data/lessons.ts](src/data/lessons.ts) and add it to the `lessons` array.

### Adding pre-configured audio for a lesson

1. Place the MP3 in `public/audio/` and the `.marks` file in `public/speech-marks/`.
2. In `src/data/lessons.ts`, import the marks file and attach `defaultAudio`:

```ts
import rawMarks03 from '../../public/speech-marks/your-lesson-03.marks?raw'

{
  ...(lesson03 as Lesson),
  defaultAudio: {
    audioUrl: 'audio/your-lesson-03.mp3',
    speechMarks: parseMarks(rawMarks03),
  },
}
```

The speech marks are embedded at build time — no runtime fetch needed.

## Generating Amazon Polly audio

1. In the AWS Console, go to **Amazon Polly → Text-to-speech**.
2. Paste the lesson dialog as plain text — **no speaker labels**, just the lines one after another.
3. Engine: **Long-Form** · Language: **English, US** · Voice: **Danielle, Female**
4. Under **Additional settings** → File format: **Speech Marks** → Speech marks types: **Word**.
5. Download the `.mp3` and `.marks` files separately (two export runs needed — one for audio, one for speech marks).
6. Place them in `public/audio/` and `public/speech-marks/`, then wire them up in `lessons.ts` (see above).

Example input for Polly (Lesson 03):
```
Are you heading off soon? It's almost five.
Yeah, nearly. What are you up to this weekend?
Nothing special — maybe a walk if the weather holds. What about you?
...
```

Example input for Polly (Lesson 05):
```
Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?
That's actually why I'm messaging. I'm so sorry — something's come up and I'm going to have to cancel.
Oh no. Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's nothing serious. My landlord's coming round in the morning and I completely forgot to put it in my calendar.
Ah, those things always seem to happen at the worst time.
I know, I feel awful about it. I was really looking forward to it.
Don't worry about it. These things happen.
Could we move it to next week? I'm free most of Thursday or Friday.
Thursday works for me. Same place, same time?
Perfect. I'll put it in my calendar right now so I don't double-book myself again.
Ha, fair enough. See you Thursday then.
See you then. And sorry again — I really appreciate you being so understanding.
```

## Planned lessons

### Uni / Data Science

- **Presenting to non-technical people** — Sarah explains a model without jargon to her professor or a stakeholder
- **Disagreeing in a meeting** — politely but clearly pushing back on someone else's point
- **Asking for feedback on a paper** — giving and receiving written feedback on a draft
- **The job interview** — Emma plays the interviewer; how to talk about your work under pressure

### Alltag

- **At the doctor's** — describing symptoms, asking questions, understanding what's said
- **Something went wrong** — politely complaining (wrong order, lost parcel) without sounding aggressive
- **Small talk at a party** — starting conversations with strangers, keeping them going, graceful exits

### Fortgeschritten

- **I don't understand** — asking targeted follow-up questions without seeming incompetent ("Could you walk me through that again?")
- **Writing that email** — Sarah and Emma discuss how to phrase a tricky message (too harsh? too soft?)
